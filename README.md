# Introduction to Big Data Processes project

This repository contains the executable files for my project, created for the course "Introduction to Big Data Processes Infrastructure 1" (MSc in Bioinformatics - University of Bologna).

The aim of the project is to design, implement and benchmark a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using Amazon Web Services (AWS), addressing the hypothetical computational challenge of aligning sequences from 1000 individuals using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) MEM algorithm.
