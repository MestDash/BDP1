# Introduction to Big Data Processes project

This repository contains the esecutable files for my BDP1 project.
The aim of the project is to design, implement and benchmark a cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) using Amazon Web Services (AWS), addressing the hypothetical computational challenge of aligning sequences from 1000 individuals using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) MEM algorithm.
